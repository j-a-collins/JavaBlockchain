# JavaBlockchain
My first attempt at implementing a blockchain using the [SHA256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) cryptographic algorithm for the fingerprint. This is mostly a proof of concept project for educational purposes - in order to better understand how a [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) functions. Simply put: a blockchain is an increasing list of records, called ***blocks***, that are linked together using cryptography.
